# RandomRecipeGenerator
Random recipe generator

## Project Requirements
1. Take some input specifying a kind of food
2. Append the string "recipe" to input
3. Run a Google search on (input + "recipe")
4. Collect the first 10 results 
5. Randomly select one of the 10 results
6.  Output the text of the recipe

## Tools we might be able to use

**BeautifulSoup**
[Website](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)

Python library for pulling data out of HTML files. We can use this
to extract recipe text after selecting a webpage from our recipe
search. 

**Google**
[Website](https://python-googlesearch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Allows you to make Google searches from Python. BeautifulSoup is
a dependency.

_Note_: Let's uh, let's just stick to Python for this because it's
a language we both know (you more than me, but w/e).
